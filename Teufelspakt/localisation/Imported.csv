EVTNAME8000600;The Proletariat Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000600;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, the workers around the world will continue to slave under bourgeois oppression. The proletariats in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000610;The Spread of Populism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000610;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of populism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be seen as shirking our duty to the populist cause. The populists in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000620;The Spread of Fundamentalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000620;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of 
fundamentalism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be admitting that we cannot aid the spread of the religious revolution. The traditionalist clerics in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000630;The Cause of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000630;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of democracy in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be seen as abandoning those who live under the rule of tyrants. Liberals in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause of world freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000640;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000640;Several of our agents in $FROMCOUNTRY$ were discovered and interrogated, and word of our efforts have spread. This will have an impact on our infamy, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ may choose to take the issue as cause for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000650;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000650;We have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty. Word of the event has leaked out, and members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are calling for immediate action!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800100;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800100;We have been contacted by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots, currently living under the dominion of a neighboring country. They suggest that there is an opportunity to stir up sentiment among those living there so that they may rise up and rejoin the mother country. There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT800100OPTA;We must free our brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT800100OPTB;It's too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Spreading Dissent;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800101;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been inciting dissent among minorities in $COUNTRY$. This is an act of aggression that deserves a swift response.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT800101OPTA;We will not tolerate this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT800101OPTB;Let it slide.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800102;We Have Been Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800102;Our efforts to incite $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been discovered. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is threatening war over this breach of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT800102OPTA;Let them come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97175OPTA;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97180OPTA;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97180OPTB;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97181OPTA;We'll be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97182;Free of Colonial Control!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97182;We are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97185;Order Restored in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97185;We have restored order to our colony in $STATENAME$... at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97185OPTA;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME201900;Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC201900;Sometimes the monarch just isn't there. Dying without a suitable or old enough heir, becoming incapable or senile while the government enters a deadlock. Sometimes the monarch is so ill that the government doesn't work and sometimes he's just away and someone incompetent was left to take care of things in his stead. Regardless of the reason, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is currently going through a regency. We can expect some instability in the years ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA201900;Terrible news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
regency_government;Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
regency_government_desc;Sickness, foreign trips, premature death or abdication - a number of reasons can trigger a regency. The fact is that our country is currently in one, the regents aren't very good at their jobs and our country is on the edge of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
coup_risk;Coup d'etat Risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
coup_risk_desc;There is dissension within the nation's military, one that is leading to a breakdown of order not only within the ranks but within the country itself. Some fear the army will rise up and take over the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
military_strife;Military Strife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
military_strife_desc;We are battling with our own army to prevent them from taking over the government. Purges are not infrequent, and the chances of soldiers defecting to join rebel causes raises with every passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup d'etat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership -- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009872OPTA;This could mean trouble down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009873;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military Coup d'etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings -- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of 'upheaval', and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTA;The army shall rule $COUNTRY$ for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTB;We will not stand for military rule in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT8000640OPTA;We shall see if this leads to anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT8000650OPTA;There will be consequences!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
