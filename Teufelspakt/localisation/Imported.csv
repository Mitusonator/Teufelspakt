EVTNAME22592;Military Base Close in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22592;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22591;Overgrown Railways in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22591;What once was one of the arteries of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry, the railway in $PROVINCENAME$ fell into such disrepair that it's path is barely visible and its tracks are unusable. Economic recession has hit $STATENAME$ harshly for the last years and without money from $CAPITAL$ being invested, most of the railways in $STATENAME$ are in such a state that they will need to be rebuilt to become train-worthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22590;$PROVINCENAME$ Old Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22590;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom. Hit with a severe economic recession in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politicians in $CAPITAL$ have no money to spend on repairing and maintaining non-essential staff and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT22590OPTA;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ will rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME60168004;$PROVINCENAME$ Military Base Damaged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60168004;Bullets whistled as the morning came in $PROVINCENAME$. Enemy soldiers engaged our troops in the roads, their artillery hoaring in the distance. Our local military base was spearheading the defense, soldiers taking turns crouching to reload and standing up to fire at the enemies. A group of enemy commandos snuck in one of the base's armouries and managed to blow it up with explosives, severely damaging the base's structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT60168004OPTA;We shall rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME60168005;Sabotage in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60168005;A cargo train hurriedly passed by the $PROVINCENAME$ railroad during dusk while human silhouettes snuck out of the railroad. They hit the wooden keys used to hold the rails in chairs with a hammer, diverting the train to a more sinuous track while forward other figures moved objects in the rail. The train was wrecked by putting objects on the high rail at a curve, and contained tons of supplies for our troops fighting in the province. Later on that night, one of our railroad bridges in $PROVINCENAME$ was burned to the ground, with no culprits found. These actions are believed to be the work of the enemy and severely crippled our railroad network.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC8000600;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, the workers around the world will continue to slave under bourgeois oppression.

EVTDESC8000610;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of populism in a neighboring state.

EVTNAME8000620;The Spread of Fundamentalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000620;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of 
fundamentalism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be admitting that we cannot aid the spread of the religious revolution.

EVTNAME8000630;The Cause of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000630;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of democracy in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be seen as abandoning those who live under the rule of tyrants. Liberals in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause of world freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000640;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000640;Several of our agents in $FROMCOUNTRY$ were discovered and interrogated, and word of our efforts have spread. This will have an impact on our infamy, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ may choose to take the issue as cause for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME8000650;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC8000650;We have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty. Word of the event has leaked out, and members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are calling for immediate action!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800100;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800100;We have been contacted by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots, currently living under the dominion of a neighboring country. They suggest that there is an opportunity to stir up sentiment among those living there so that they may rise up and rejoin the mother country. There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97175OPTA;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME201900;Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC201900;Sometimes the monarch just isn't there. Dying without a suitable or old enough heir, becoming incapable or senile while the government enters a deadlock. Sometimes the monarch is so ill that the government doesn't work and sometimes he's just away and someone incompetent was left to take care of things in his stead. Regardless of the reason, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is currently going through a regency. We can expect some instability in the years ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup d'etat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership -- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings -- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers.
